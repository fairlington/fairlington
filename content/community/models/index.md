The three-dimensional models of the Fairlington community used in the sales office in the 1970’s have been conserved and are on display at the Fairlington Community Center (3308 South Stafford Street).

FHS collaborated with the Arlington County Office of Historic Preservation and the Fairlington Citizens Association to restore the models and mount them on the wall opposite Room 103 in the Fairlington Community Center.
