# July Fourth Parade

Fairlington has long celebrated the Fourth of July with a parade and  after-party. Evolving and growing each year, this event brings the  entire community together in an always memorable neighborhood event.

In 2005, FHS commissioned a video of the parade, showcasing the event and the comments of participants and watchers.

**Special thanks to Barbara Ballo**, filmmaker and Fairlington resident, who shot, edited, and produced the video.
