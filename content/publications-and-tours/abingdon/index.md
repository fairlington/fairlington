Abingdon first opened its doors to students in August 1950. The school has been in continuous operation since then, educating generations of students in South Arlington.

## Summary

The federal government built Fairlington during World War II as housing for workers at the recently-built Pentagon. Fairlington Elementary School (now the Fairlington Community Center) opened in 1944 to serve the families of those living in Fairlington. Following the war there was a "baby boom," and it became clear that Fairlington Elementary did not have sufficient capacity for the neighborhood's children. The Arlington School Board proposed building an addition to Fairlington Elementary, but [the neighborhood took a survey of families to show that such an addition would be overwhelmed by the number of children about to enter the school system](images/1947-10-22.png). As a result, the School Board opted to build a new school in North Fairlington - Abingdon Elementary School.

The groundbreaking ceremony for Abingdon Elementary was held on October 29, 1949. [Several future students participated by digging with shovels at the site where the school was going to be built](images/1949-11-04.jpg). Additionally, [several local dignitaries gave speeches](pdf/abingdon-groundbreaking.pdf), including School Board and County Board members.

[Abingdon was dedicated on August 20, 1950.](images/1950-08-21.png) Abingdon had ten classrooms, a multipurpose room (which served as a gym, cafeteria and a meeting place), as well as a front office, a principal's office, a nurse's office, and a teacher's lounge. [The original floor plan can be viewed here.](pdf/floor-plan-1949.pdf) All ten original classrooms still serve as classrooms today. The multipurpose room, which served as the cafeteria and the gymnasium, has since been divided into two classrooms currently used by preschool students.

Abingdon served only grades 1-3 in its first years, though it would accept grades 1-6 by the end of the decade. Despite only serving three grades, Abingdon was overcrowded in its first year. [Eight of ten classrooms had more than 35 students, and four classrooms had 46 or 47 students.](images/1950-11-21.jpg) This overcrowding would be relieved by the opening of Claremont Elementary in 1952. For the subsequent two decades, Abingdon would only admit students who lived in North Fairlington or Shirlington.

Abingdon was a lively school. [A parent handbook from 1957](pdf/parent-handbook-1957-1958.pdf) shows that there were several student volunteer organizations, including Safety Patrols and a Student Council. Parents were heavily involved from the start as well: [the school had the first parent volunteer crossing guards ("Mothers' Volunteer Patrol") in the country](images/1951-01-21_1.png), in addition to [a robust PTA](images/1951-09-01.png). The building also hosted several community events after the school day, including [dances for local teenagers](images/1950-09-22.jpg) and civic association meetings.

Abingdon was a segregated school in its first years. Black students were not allowed to enroll; Black students living in South Arlington attended Drew Elementary. Abingdon remained segregated long after the Supreme Court's 1954 ban on segregation in public schools, and Arlington's 1959 integration of Stratford Junior High, because [the apartment complexes that constituted Abingdon's attendance zone were openly discriminatory](images/1966-04-03.png). The Fair Housing Act of 1968 affirmed that housing discrimination was illegal, which paved the way for [the first three Black students to attend Abingdon in 1968](images/1969-05-13.jpg). One of these students stated that her time at Abingdon was difficult, but we know little else about Abingdon's integration.

Abingdon's student body became far more diverse in subsequent years. A busing program from nearby Green Valley ensured some diversity, and [refugees from Southeast Asia enrolled at the end of the Vietnam War](images/1975-09-12.png). Abingdon's student population was also bolstered by the closure of neighboring schools due to low enrollment: Fairlington Elementary closed for good in 1978, and Claremont Elementary closed in 1983 (though it would later reopen). All students at both schools attended Abingdon after the closures.

In 1985, [the Abingdon community came together to build a new playground](pdf/playground-dedication.pdf). The playground was designed by celebrity playground architect Robert Leathers, and was shaped like the United States. This was a significant event and a great source of pride for the community.

[Abingdon has had four renovations/additions since its construction in 1950](#renovations-and-additions), with the most recent renovation concluding in 2018. These additions from various eras can make Abingdon feel like a maze. Some of the exposed brick in the hallways near the front entrance used to be an exterior wall, before additions were built around it.

### 1985 Playground Construction

The photos below show the construction of the "Leathers Playground" in April 1985. The playground was designed by Robert Leathers, a celebrity playground architect whose designs were constructed over multiple days by hundreds of community volunteers. ([The Washington Post published an article describing some of Abingdon's planning efforts.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1984/11/07/volunteers-work-is-childs-play/ca319fea-11f5-4f64-befd-271dce5697f9/)) For additional information about the 1985 playground, see the [dedication document](pdf/playground-dedication.pdf) and the [community newsletter](pdf/playground-fca-bulletin.pdf) in the documents section.

The following photos and flyers were provided by Meghan Fatouros, Abingdon's librarian. They were contained in a scrapbook stored in Abingdon's library.
