The FHS is governed by a Board of Trustees. Our goals encompass a range of community, education, preservation, and publication work. Board members are elected for three year terms.

In 2023, the Fairlington Historical Society elected a new board:

- **President**: Beth Hoffman
- **Vice President**: Martha Herrmann
- **Secretary**: Lisa Sabol
- **Treasurer**: Dan Burd

The board is excited to showcase Fairlington's history in new and interesting ways. We look forward to sharing more about our plans on our website soon.

Board members would also like to express their sincere gratitude for previous board members Terry Placek, Patty Clark and Cindy Kunz. Terry, Patty and Cindy served on the FHS board for over twenty years and furthered the organization's mission in countless ways. They have left the organization in excellent condition.
