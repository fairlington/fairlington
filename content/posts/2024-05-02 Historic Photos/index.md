Arlington County’s Planning Office recently provided a number of historic photographs to the Arlington County Public Library’s Center for Local History. [The Bill Thomas Historic Preservation Photo Collection, 1920s-2010](https://libraryarchives.arlingtonva.us/Detail/collections/14520), documents neighborhoods, roads and highways across the county from the 1920s through the 1980s. Included in this collection are undated photos of Fairlington, likely taken shortly after Fairlington's construction. 

### Who was Bill Thomas?

Bill Thomas was born and raised in Arlington and worked with the Arlington County Government for decades, beginning in the late 1970s. During his employment with the Historic Preservation section of the Arlington County Department of Community Planning, Housing, and Development (CPHD), he collected and used these records. Bill Thomas held several positions in CPHD, including his roles as Business Conservation Program Coordinator and Comprehensive Planning Supervisor. He also served as Data and Research Section Supervisor and played a major role in Regional and Federal interactions and negotiations. 

This collection is comprised primarily of photographs – both originals and copies – depicting neighborhoods, roads and highways, shopping centers, residential buildings, commercial buildings, county government buildings, and parks and playgrounds across Arlington County from the 1920s through the 1980s. Many photographs are stamped or otherwise marked for use by the Arlington County Planning Office (a division of CPHD), the Department of Environmental Affairs, and the Department of Parks and Recreation. 

We hope you enjoy the photographs of Fairlington as much as we did!
