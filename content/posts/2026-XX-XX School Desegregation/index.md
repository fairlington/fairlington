Both Fairlington Elementary (built in 1943) and Abingdon Elementary (built in 1950) were segregated schools in their first years. All public schools were required by the state constitution to be segregated. Black students living in South Arlington attended Drew Elementary School.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that school desegregation was unconstitutional and ordered that they be integrated.
