Fairlingtonians have always been interested in their own history. In addition to the 50th anniversary booklet, [which is available to order](/fairlington-at-50/), Fairlingtonians also drafted anniversary booklets for the neighborhood's 10th and 40th anniversaries. For the first time, those booklets have been scanned and are available below. Enjoy!
