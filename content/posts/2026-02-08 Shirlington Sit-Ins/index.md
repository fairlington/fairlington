In the 1950s and 1960s, department stores often featured lunch counters to serve simple dishes to hungry shoppers. Though the stores themselves sold goods to individuals of all races, the lunch counters only served White customers.

In June 1960, sit-ins took place at lunch counters in Arlington as a peaceful protest aimed at integrating service at the lunch counters. These sit-ins were part of a movement across the South that vegan with [sit-ins in Greensboro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins) in February of that year. (This, in turn, had been influenced by the [first recorded sit-in for racial equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Library_sit-in) at what is now the Kate Waller Barrett Branch Library in Alexandria.)

The sit-ins in Arlington began in North Arlington on June 9, 1960 at the Peoples Drug Store in Cherrydale, and spread to nearby lunch counters. These sit-ins were tumultuous, with counter-protesters employing violence and intimidation at some of the sites. Protesters declared a pause after June 10 to allow for the business owners to consider the protesters' demands. However, after not receiving a satisfactory reply, they resumed their demonstrations on June 18, this time in South Arlington.

In contrast, the Shirlington sit-ins were peaceful. Several protesters, both White and Black, sat down at lunch counters at Woolworth's and Lansburgh's department stores. A White demonstrator purchased two meals and gave one to her fellow demonstrator, who was Black. Soon afterwards, the lunch counters were closed and the lights turned off, although another Black protester was served food, probably by accident. Protesters remained at the darkened lunch counters for hours.

This second round of protests were very effective. Within days, most chain lunch counters in Northern Virginia abruptly desegregated, even those that had not had any sit-ins. Contemporary commentators speculated that business owners were likely not opposed to integration, given that many owned integrated lunch counters in the District, but they had been fearful of being the first to integrate in Virginia.

Neighbors of all races sharing meals together in public was a significant step in the decades-long struggle for civil rights in Arlington.
