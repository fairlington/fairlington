Earlier this year, local PBS affiliate WETA produced an episode of their program "If You Lived Here" about neighborhoods in South Arlington. The episode included a home in Fairlington, as well as a home in Claremont and a condominium on Four Mile Run Drive. The episode features the Fairlington Historical Society's very own president, Beth Hoffman, speaking about Fairlington's history.

The link to the full episode is below. We are also sharing links to the portion where Beth spoke about Fairlington's history, and to the portion where a contemporary Fairlington home was explored by the show's hosts.
