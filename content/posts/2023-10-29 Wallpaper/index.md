This piece of vinyl wallpaper was removed from the common wall in the kitchen of the townhouse (Clarendon) at 4829 27th Road South during the remodeling of the kitchen in the summer of 2011.

Since the wallpaper is behind the framing for the installation of the range, associated with the time of the conversion to condominiums, the wallpaper would then pre-date the 1970's. Also notable for dating is the old fuse box.
