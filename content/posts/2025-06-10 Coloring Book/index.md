Attention, artists of all ages, we need your help! The Fairlington Historical Society is developing a special Fairlington community coloring book! If you enjoy drawing, we’d be delighted to showcase your artwork in the coloring book we will distribute to children at upcoming Fairlington events.

We're looking for artwork illustrating Fairlington’s nature, activities, and landscapes. Please email an 8.5” x 11” sized black lined drawing PDF file(s) to president@fairlingtonhistoricalsociety.org. Or deliver your artwork to the Fairlington Villages Management Office at 3001 S. Abingdon St.

If you'd like to receive credit for your artwork, please include your name in the email or attach a note to the piece you drop off. We are excited to receive all final artwork by the end of the summer. We aim to have the coloring book ready for distribution in September.
