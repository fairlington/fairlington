The Fairlington Historical Society has scanned several documents that help tell the story of Fairlington's first days. These documents have been preserved by the Arlington Public Library in their archives, and are available for review upon request.

The documents are made available in the library with little or no context. We've tried to provide as much context as possible.

The documents below are a small portion of what the Fairlington-related documents that the library maintains. FHS endeavors to continue making additional documents available electronically.

## Photos

These are photos of Fairlington in possession of Arlington Public Library. Only one has context: the first photo features the first homeowners to move into their new unit in "Village 1" - that is, Fairlington Commons. That is likely James and Sandra Willis, who purchased 4651 34th Street South in 1973 for $38,175.
